# 02. First letter in capital, the rest in lower case (more than one parameter/word)

The main difference with the previous problem is that you can use more than one parameter and more than one word (even in each parameter)

**Examples:**

- Input : "HellOOO WorlD" "guys" / Output: "Hellooo World" "Guys"

- Input : " HellOOO " "WorlD" " guyS" / Output: " Hellooo " "World" " Guys"

- Input : " HellOOO  W000RLD" / Output: " Hellooo  W000rld"
