00. First letter in capital, the rest in lower case (just one word)

I think this a good title, just in case of misunderstand, we have to read a word using a console program. The output has to be the same word with the letter changed according the goal of the problem (I mean, the title :)

Example:
Input : "HellOOO"
Output: "Hellooo"
