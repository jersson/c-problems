01. First letter in capital, the rest in lower case (more than one word)

We have to read a phrase using a console program. The output has to be the same phrase with the letter changed according the goal of the problem (I mean, first letter of every word)

Example:
Input : "HellOOO WorlD"
Output: "Hellooo World"

Input : " HellOOO WorlD"
Output: " Hellooo World"

Input : " HellOOO  W000RLD"
Output: " Hellooo  W000rld"
