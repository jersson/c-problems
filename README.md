# c-problems
How can I solve C problems using the least amount of resources?
---
I've just finished the 42 Silicon Valley August 2019 Piscine and I though "maybe I need a space to write some programs according their rules"
So, long story shot, I want to write and share some problems/solutions avoiding:
- For or similar loop sentences (just while)
- Too many lines of code per function (25 was the number)
- Line of code not so long (80 was the number)
- Not so many C default libraries (that's why I think this is kinda tricky)

Anyway, I'm learning here, join if you are interested.
